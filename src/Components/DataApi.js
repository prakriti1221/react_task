        description2: "<p>We adopt frontier technologies like drones and virtual reality for efficient surveying and mapping and interactive navigation. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or Drones are the emerging technological tools that help to capture high-resolution images of the earth&rsquo;s surfaces and objects over it while Virtual Reality is a type of reality emulation that the user becomes part of and it convinces the human brain of being in a real environment.</p>\r\n<p>We conduct drone flights for spatial data collection on a large scale. Drone image processing and data analysis are our technical competencies. We perform flight planning, capture aerial datasets, and image processing for UAV based data collection and mapping projects. These projects can be useful for collecting spatial data, mapping the earth&rsquo;s surface features, and carrying out research in the field of surveying and mapping, development projects, agriculture, and the environment.</p>",

        description2: "<p>Besides the active projects that we do, we also put a lot of effort into training, awareness, and soft approaches for promoting mapping as a vital domain. Being one of the earliest startups focusing on geoinformation management and digital mapping in Nepal, NAXA has played a vital role in taking forward the whole sector of digital mapping in a country where mapping was in a really primitive form. The company has advocated for the significance of geodata in better planning and analysis. This includes a series of map literacy training, GIS mapping training, and also crowd mapping sessions that the company has voluntarily engaged in.</p>\r\n<p>We provide tailored training packages in GIS Mapping, OpenStreetMap, and Web GIS to students, researchers, and government and non-government officials. We also carry out research on the localization of the latest geospatial technologies. The team has gained good experience in leading training, advocacy sessions, and technical engagement around the same.</p>",

We emphasize digital mapping and provide services that allow users to create maps in a digital medium, interact over the maps, and draw meaningful information via map-based queries. We specialize in the development of online GIS applications to visualize and analyze spatial datasets.</p>\r\n<p>We develop location-based digital mapping applications and services for both web and mobile platforms. We also develop geo-portals that allow the organization and even government bodies to create and maintain a map-based inventory of their works, projects, or any other datasets that can be associated with specific locations. Besides, We have developed our custom methodology for Participatory mapping in the communities of Nepal where we combine Digital Mapping techniques with the community-based participatory approach to come up with an updated map of the community in both papers as well as a digital medium.</p>",

We develop software systems and digital solutions that contribute to data visualization in different forms. We prepare maps on paper as per Client requests, be it Topographical Maps, Tourist Maps, or Project location maps, we provide mapping services under different themes. We design both hard copy and soft copy atlas maps to visualize thematic map data in an easily understandable format. We also develop Information boards both static and interactive digital map boards, which can be installed on streets and outside locations to disseminate map-based information.</p>",
